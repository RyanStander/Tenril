    m_Localized: Lunnadian, the God of the Moon. She provides us with food and protection
      of nature. Perhaps you know her by a different name.

    m_Localized: You must have lived quite the secluded life. The Tieflings are another
      humanoid race like us. They praise fire and want to burn anything that they
      can. They always attack us and don't care for anyone but themselves.

    m_Localized: Y-yes I am. But it's just a few cuts.

  - m_Id: 1812089511936
    m_Localized: Don't worry about me, but you seem to be well geared. Could you
      stop them before they hurt anyone else? I'd be in debt to you if you can get
      rid of them.
