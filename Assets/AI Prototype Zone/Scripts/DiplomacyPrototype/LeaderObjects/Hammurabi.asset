  insultingStatements:
  - Your words are perjury. Your oaths are a field in time of famine. Great Anu,
    forgive me for speaking with this one!
  - Lawless vulture, profaner of shrines, one who is hated by many gods! It is only
    by my great mercy that I still speak with you.
  - Who are you to oppose Hammurabi? You are dust, mere dirt I shake from my sandals.
  - You must do what I tell you, or I may destroy you.
  complimentaryStatements:
  - Like two horses pulling a common chariot, so shall our friendship pull us forward!
  - To copy Hammurabi is the best course. You do this, which is good.
  neutralStatements:
  - Come and see the glories of Babylon and see our gardens - the desert blooms with
    life!
  - We invite you to taste the riches of Babylon. This dish is called 'the unwinding'.
