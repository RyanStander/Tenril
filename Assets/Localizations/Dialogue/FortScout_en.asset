    m_Localized: By Lunnadian, you must have been sent to help me! I scouted out
      the Tiefling fort and it's swarming with them! They nearly caught me but I
      got away.

    m_Localized: Lunnadian, the God of the Moon. She provides us with food and protection
      of nature. Perhaps you know her by a different name.

    m_Localized: Did they not already brief you on this? The Tieflings are another
      humanoid race like us. They praise fire and want to burn anything that they
      can. They always attack us and don't care for anyone but themselves. They capured
      this fort a few weeks ago and are rallying forces for another attack.

    m_Localized: Y-yes I am. But I'll be fine, injuries are surprisingly common for
      scouts, we're trained to patch up our wounds quickly.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3459494412288
    m_Localized: I need you to clear out the fort so that we can take control of
      it. Our reinforcements are still a few days away, but we can not risk them
      fortifying this place any further.
